=========================

This repository contains tools and tricks for processing data before analysis using ML algorithms. I follow Chapter 4 of Sebastian Raschka's Python Machine Learning.

How to handle missing data?
---------------------------

I have written my own algorithms for this in R. Not only that the operations in the algorithm actually commute. Here I use built-in features from scikit-learn.

Class labeling

Splitting dataset into test and train subsets

How to choose features of interest from the dataset?
